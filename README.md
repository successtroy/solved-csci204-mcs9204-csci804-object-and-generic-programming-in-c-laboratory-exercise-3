<strong>Task: Constructors, destructor (1.0)</strong>

Define a class <strong>BigInteger</strong> in a file <strong>BigInteger.h</strong> that can be used to store a large positive integer. The class contains two data members: a pointer of short integer and the size of the dynamic short integer array. Define the following member functions:

<ul>

 <li>The default constructor;</li>

 <li>An initialization constructor initializes a BigInteger instance with a long long integer;</li>

 <li>An initialization constructor initializes a BigInteger instance with a char array, in which all elements are decimal digits.</li>

 <li>The copy constructor makes a deep copy from a BigInteger instance.</li>

 <li>The destructor;</li>

 <li>Add function adds the current instance with another BigInteger instance and returns the result of the addition.</li>

 <li>Print function print out the current BigInteger value to an output stream.</li>

</ul>

Implement the member functions defined above in a file <strong>BigInteger.cpp</strong>.

Write the driver program include main function in a file <strong>testMain.cpp</strong> to declare instances of BigInteger, test all the member functions defined above. The values are up to you (Do not read input data from the keyboard or a file).
